# :closed_lock_with_key: CodeBurger API 
#### :wind_chime: This is a Hamburger API project to manage orders and products in a hamburger shop. Developed with Node.js and Express, using a variety of tools and technologies to offer a robust and scalable solution. This API has been specially designed for integration with PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases, using Docker to facilitate the management and deployment of these databases. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for an organized and scalable structure, like PostgreSQL.

Open vscode.

üë®üèæ‚Äçüíª Open a terminal and make a clone of the project.
```

<img src="https://github.com/stanley-rodrigues/picForReadme/blob/main/api%20Devburguer/colar%20link%20api.png"/>

After making the clone, while the terminal is still open, type the command "cd api-dev-burger" and press enter. 
```
cd api-dev-burger
```
In the terminal, give the command "yarn install" to download the project's dependencies. 
```
yarn install
```
After downloading the project's dependencies, you'll need to upload the containers with the postgres and mongoDB databases using the commands in the terminal:

```
docker run --name codeburger-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```
Then the MongoDB container
```
docker run --name mongo -p 27017:27017 -d -t mongo
```

After the two contaneires have been created, open docker and start them both.After the two contaneires have been created, open docker and start them both.
